This mindfactory monitor will notify you via email once a new product has been released for a decent price. To send emails we will be using nodemailer and to make a request towards mindfactory we will use the HTTP request libary got.

Install the following on your machine:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (comes with npm)

## Install the dependencies to run this project

1. `$ npm install`
2. `$ npm install got`
3. `$ npm install node-html-parser`
4. `$ npm install nodemailer`
5. `$ npm install dotenv`

Feel free to tell me what you think about my code and please don't expect much from it because i recently started coding bots and i am nowhere near a pro. I tried to keep it simple and logical for me! I wish you a great day :)
